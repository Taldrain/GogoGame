\chapter*{Introduction}

This report is about the GO contest of the AI course.\\
It contains detailed description of the AI project.\\
\\
At the beginning the project was designed in C++ but then we decide to change to
a completly different langage OCaml.\\
With this powerfull langage we managed to write some great algorithm like an UCT
or a Neural Network.\\


\chapter{Common Part}

In this part, we will discut about the common work of the group.

Firstly, we will discuss our choice to use OCaml, a functionnal language.
Then, we will see the differents algorithms we choose to implement and, last but not least, we will analyze our results.

\section{The choice of a functionnal Language}

\subsection{Explanations}

The classics way for programming this project was C or C++. It's the general choice, the choice that a lot of groups make.

Otherwise, these languages are lacking a lot on sides that matters from an strictly algorithmic point of view.

The most important problem with C-based languages is that they are state-based. A variable is a location on the memory and the programmer have to manage this memory himself, changing value by hand.\\

In this way, programming have a lot of side-effects, and the whole program is weakened by  an approximative memory gestion.

Good programmers use the manual memory gestion as an advantage in order to gain efficiencity, but our project is not about memory gestion but Articifial Intelligence algorithms.\\

On the other way, functionnal programming avoid mutable variables and changing states but use functionnal application of contants values.

This permit a way of programming with very few side-effects, with less memory management, and permit to be more focused on the algorithm itself.

\subsection{Why OCaml}

There is differents functionnal programming langagues : \textsc{Lisp}, Haskell, OCaml, Erlang\ldots

We choose OCaml because:
\begin{itemize}
\item It is really fast
\item It is Object Oriented ready
\item It have many mature tools helping for project management
\item And, mainly, because we were all already familar with OCaml
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Genetic Algorithm and Neural Network}
Because we knowed that a lot of game of Go (already played) are easily
accessible we wanted to have an easy way to know if it's better to attack or
defend at a t time. This is possible by a genetic algorithm and a neural
network.\\
\\
We create a neural network, no intern layout it's not necessary for what we
want, that have in input the number of vertice in a Go board and in output we
have the response, we know if we have to attack or defend.\\
Of course it's necessay to do some learning because otherwise we would have to
test each combination of weight for each node. Speaking of which, the function
used to determine the output is the Sigmoid function.\\
\\
So, the other part is the genetic algorithm. It's independant with the
neural network but necessary. In our project we used it to shuffle, mutate and
do some cross-over with our data of weight.\\
After that we have a completly new population, supposed better, that we take to
replace our current data of weight in our neural network.\\
\\
These two algorithms have been implemented in a completly generic way so that we
can use them for whatever we want.\\

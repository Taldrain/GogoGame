This project has been coded with linux tools, under the distributions Ubuntu
and Arch Linux.
As OCaml is a multiplateform language, you can certainly compile it for Windows
and Mac, but it will be painfull.

  List of package needed for:

  ** Ubuntu:
    ocaml-native-compilers
    ocaml-findlib
    libbatteries-ocaml-dev
    oasis

  ** Archlinux:
    ocaml
    ocaml-findlib
    ocaml-batteries (in the AUR)


3. Installation
  After all dependences are install we can use these command to interact with the
project:

  To compile the project:
    $ make

  You should know have access to the binaries of the project "gogogame" at the
root of the directory

  You can then clean the directory:
    $ make clean

  Or call for a spring clean:
    $ make mrproper

\chapter{In the beginning}

\chapter{Common part}
In this chapter I will described the most important algorithm that our programm
is using and also why we choosed it.\\

\section{Genetique Algorithm and Neural Network}
Because we knowed that a lot of game of go (already played) are easily
accessible we wanted to have easy way to know if it's better to attack or defend
at a t time. This is possible by a genetic algorithm and a neural network.\\
\\
We create a neural network, no intern layout it's not necessary for what we
want, that have in input the number of vertice in a Go board and in output we
have the response, we know if we have to attack or defend.\\
Of course it's necessay to do some learning because otherwise we would have to
test each combination of weight for each node. Speaking of which, the function
used to determine the output is the Sigmoid function.\\
\\
So, the other part is the genetic algorithm. It's independant with the
neural network but necessary. In our project we used it to shuffle, mutate and
do some cross-over with our data of weight.\\
After that we have a completly new population, supposed better, that we take to
replace our current data of weight in our neural network.\\
\\
These two algorithms have been implemented in a completly generic way so that we
can use them for whatever we want.\\

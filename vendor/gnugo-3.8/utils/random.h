/* This random number generator produces 32 bit unsigned integers, no
 * more, no less. Internally in the algorithm and for storing the
 * state we need a type that is at least 32 bits wide. A longer type
 * doesn't hurt but means a waste of bits.
 *
 * ISO C guarantees that an unsigned long always is at least 32 bits.
 * It is not uncommon, however, that it is longer. An unsigned int is
 * not guaranteed to be more than 16 bits wide, but on modern
 * platforms we can be certain that this type too is 32 bits (or
 * more). Also the GNU Coding Standards explicitly state that the
 * possibility of ints shorter than 32 bits should be ignored.
 *
 * We could make a typedef here to choose exactly which type to use.
 * In order to avoid various complications in the interface to the
 * random number generator, however, we prefer to consistently use
 * unsigned int internally and we assume this type to be at least 32
 * bits wide.

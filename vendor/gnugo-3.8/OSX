If you have Mac OS X you can build GNU Go using Apple's compiler, which
is derived from GCC. You will need Xcode.

   One issue is that the configure test for socket support is too
conservative. On OS/X, the configure test fails, but actually socket
support exists. So if you want to be able to connect to the engine
through tcp/ip (using gtp) you may `configure --enable-socket-support'.
There will be an error message but you may build the engine and socket
support should work.

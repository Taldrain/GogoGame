.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\s-1GNU\s0 Go plays a game of Go against the user. It has many other features: it 
can play against itself or another program, analyse and score a recorded 
game. \s-1GNU\s0 Go is compliant with Go modem protocol, load and save game in
the Smart Game format. 
.PP
\&\s-1GNU\s0 Go default is a simple alpha-numeric board display, but you can use
a client such as \fBCGoban\fR.
.Sh "The game of Go"
.IX Subsection "The game of Go"
Go is a game of strategy between two players usually played on a
19x19 grid called \fBgoban\fR. The two players put black and white \fBstones\fR on
the goban to enclose \fBterritory\fR. Go was invented about 4000 years ago in
ancient China. Other names for this game are (Chinese) \fBWei Chi\fR, (Korean)
\&\fBBaduk\fR and (Ing) \fBGoe\fR.
.Sh "Playing a game in \s-1ASCII\s0 mode"
.IX Subsection "Playing a game in ASCII mode"
To start a game with default options, just invoke \*(L"gnugo\*(R". The board will be
drawn at your terminal using \s-1ASCII\s0 letters.  In this mode, you can get help on
available commands by the \fBh\fR key.  To play as Black with 4 stones handicap,
with a 0.5 komi, recording the game in the file record.sgf:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& gnugo --color black --handicap 4 --komi 0.5 -o record.sgf
.Ve
.Sh "Playing a game with CGoban"
.IX Subsection "Playing a game with CGoban"
CGoban is a general purpose client program by Bill Shubert for
playing Go. It runs under X Window System with a beautiful resizeable
graphic display. To use \s-1GNU\s0 Go under X Window System, obtain the
most recent version of CGoban from Bill Shubert's web site
.PP
http://www.igoweb.org/~wms/comp/cgoban/index.html
.PP
Start CGoban. When the CGoban Control panel comes up, select `Go Modem.'
You will get the Go Modem Protocol Setup. Choose one (or both) of the
players to be ``Program,'' and fill out the box to the path to
gnugo. After clicking \s-1OK\s0, you get the Game Setup window. Choose
``Rules Set'' to be Japanese (otherwise handicaps won't work). Set the
board size and handicap if you want. Click \s-1OK\s0 and you are ready to go.
.PP
In the Go Modem Protocol Setup window, when you specify the path
to \s-1GNU\s0 Go, you can give it command line options, such as \-\-quiet
to suppress most messages. Since the Go Modem Protocol preempts
standard I/O, other messages are sent to stderr, even if they are
not error messages. These will appear in the terminal from which
you started CGoban. 
.Sh "Scoring system"
.IX Subsection "Scoring system"
The game stops when both players pass. \s-1GNU\s0 Go will attempt to
compute and report the score to you. It may occasionally make
mistakes due to wrong evaluation of the status of a group. You
can check the score as follows. In \s-1ASCII\s0 mode, at the end of
the game, stones believed dead are marked in lower case letters,
and you have the option of toggling their status before counting.
Using CGoban, you may use CGoban's counting facility to count
the game using either Japanese or Chinese rules.
.Sh "Viewing a stored game"
.IX Subsection "Viewing a stored game"
gnugo \fB\-l\fR filename.sgf \-\-mode ascii
.PP
loads filename.sgf and lets you navigate through the game by using the
commands \fIforward\fR, \fIback\fR, \fIgoto\fR and \fIlast\fR.
It is not possible to navigate through variations in ascii mode.
You may also use CGoban to view stored games. CGoban can navigate
variations.
.Sh "Documentation"
.IX Subsection "Documentation"
The files in the \fIdoc\fR directory contain detailed documentation about
debugging options and internal program structure. Other documentation may
be found in comments throughout the source code.
.Sh "Go Modem Protocol"
.IX Subsection "Go Modem Protocol"
The Go Modem Protocol is a standard interface between Go programs and
graphical display. 
.PP
The Go Modem Protocol was developed by Bruce Wilcox with input from
David Fotland, Anders Kierulf and others. Any Go program *should*
use this protocol since it is standard. Since CGoban supports this
protocol, the user interface for any Go program can be done
entirely through CGoban. Using the Go Modem Protocol, you can play
with another computer running a different program (even on a
different operating system) using a modem, a serial cable or over
the internet if the other program also supports the protocol. You
can also communicate with the Go servers using CGoban.
.Sh "Smart Game Format"
.IX Subsection "Smart Game Format"
Games (with comments, variations and other features) can be
stored in the Smart Game Format (\s-1SGF\s0). This format originated in
Anders Kierulf's program Smart Go. Martin Muller and Arno
Hollosi developed the current standard, which may be found
at 
.PP
http://www.red-bean.com/sgf/
.PP
\&\s-1GNU\s0 Go supports the Smart Game Format.
.SH "OPTIONS"

\&\fBgnugo \-\-score estimate \-l filename\fR
.PP
Loads the \s-1SGF\s0 file and estimates the score by measuring the
influence. Use with \fB\-L\fR if you want the estimate somewhere else than
at the end of the file.
.PP

the results will also be written as comment at the end of the output file.
.PP
\&\fB\*(--printsgf \f(BIoutfile\fB\fR
.PP

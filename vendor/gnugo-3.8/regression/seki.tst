# The theme of this test suite is how to play inside an already living
# group to turn potential territory into a seki. A typical example
# would be this corner group
# 
# |OOOOOO
# |XXXXXO
# |..a.XO
# |....XO
# +------
# 
# where white can make seki in sente by playing at 'a'. There are also
# numerous test cases to check the followup moves to get a seki. In
# many cases one or both players have the option to make ko for life
# and death of the entire corner (whereby black would get territory
# points if winning). Is is generally assumed in this test suite that
# white tries to achieve ko while black tries to avoid it, since the
# ko in most cases is favorable to white.

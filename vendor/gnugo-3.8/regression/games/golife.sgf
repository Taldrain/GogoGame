;B[fd];W[gc]C[
golife NR : Golife normally plays rather fast now. Haven't worked on it for a couple of years...
]
;B[cg];W[fc]C[
golife NR : It also has a lousy interface, so I better not screw up...
]
;B[ed];W[db];B[ge];W[cd]C[
NE NR : this looks good for B (8)
]
;B[hd];W[gg];B[bc]C[
golife NR : wow...
ingwa 6k*: A daring invasion (11)
golife NR : wow...
ingwa 6k*: And yours also (11)
golife NR : Indeed :-)
NE NR : B7 must be a mistake (11)
]
;W[hf];B[cf]C[
bump started observation.
jpyllman started observation.
]
;W[bd];B[dd]C[
golife NR : with this speed it will be over in no time.
ingwa 6k*: Perhaps, but computers can complicate things very much (15)
]
;W[ac]C[
golife NR : The lookahead is rather shallow as set. How much lookahead does gnugo do?
gunnar 3k : C7 is of course much better than A7. (16)
]
;B[ab]C[
golife NR : A8 not much better...
gunnar 3k : A8 looks unreasonable. (17)
]
;W[cc];B[gb]C[
golife NR : hmm... getting complicated.
]
;W[hc];B[hb]C[
ingwa 6k*: Lookahead: 16 plys (21)
gunnar 3k : Black is helping white to get stronger. White has H5 for connection now. (21)
golife NR : 16 plys is a lot. Only on a restricted set of moves, I take it.
]
;W[ib];B[ia]C[
golife NR : It's getting worse and worse.
Micke started observation.
turvoy 5k : neverknow (23)
ingwa 6k*: Yes, only on tactical reading (23)
ingwa 6k*: Capturing and such (23)
ingwa 6k*: No full width search (23)
]
;W[fb]C[
NE NR : If W doesn't win this game I will be most surprised (24)
]
;B[bb]C[
golife NR : both programs like suspense :-)
gunnar 3k : Many odd moves now. (25)
]
;W[ha]C[
NE NR : gnugo doesn't like to capture stones? (26)
]
;B[ic]C[
strandhag started observation.
golife NR : what is this? I played several games today, and it did not do such moves then...
gunnar 3k : I'm still waiting for H5 to connect. (27)
]
;W[id]C[
mik started observation.
]
;B[ga]C[
golife NR : I predict an easy win for gnugo at this stage :-)
teun NR : gnugo takes plenty of time here (29)

;W[ce]C[burtabel [3d\]: thats not too unreasonable
];B[cg];W[hb]
C[gunnar [?\]: But too pessimistic if it wants to win the game.

C[zapp [?\]: Viking is still worried about the lower left

C[gunnar [?\]: I'm starting to think that GNU's biggest problem in 9x9 games is that it's foo fond of early second line moves.

C[zapp [?\]: Actually I had a version of viking that played a lot on the 2nd line and won surprisingly often

C[gunnar [?\]: Did Viking play second move from opening book?
];W[eg]
;B[cf];W[gh]C[zapp [?\]: I did not see it play it
];B[ec]
C[gunnar [?\]: (It was very fast.)
gunnar [?\]: G2 looks a bit low.
zapp [?\]: Then it was
]
;W[fb];B[eb]C[gunnar [?\]: GNU thinks W+6.
gunnar [?\]: G5 was third move.
]
;W[gf];B[dg]C[zapp [?\]: Viking thinks it is 50+50
gunnar [?\]: W+10 now.
gunnar [?\]: GNU very pessimistic.
]
;W[dh];B[ch]C[zapp [?\]: Should be with big komi
zapp [?\]: Viking tends to always beat gnu in a game like this
gunnar [?\]: W+12. It gets worse with every move.
]
;W[cg];B[bg]C[gunnar [?\]: C3?
zapp [?\]: Can be a symptom that Viking is behind
Dssq [9k?\]: C3 = 9P move
]
;W[ei];B[ge]C[gunnar [?\]: Finally G5.
gunnar [?\]: W+4 now.
];W[fe]
;B[fd]C[zapp [?\]: Viking was thinking of H5
zapp [?\]: but ran out of time
gunnar [?\]: Ah, F5 didn't look very good.

;W[ff];B[gd]C[zapp [?\]: I am playing on my laptop today
zapp [?\]: Last time I had my father 3Ghz machine
gunnar [?\]: What speed?
zapp [?\]: 1.7

;W[hd];B[hb]
C[zapp [?\]: And that tournament I think the time per game was longer

C[gunnar [?\]: GNU is playing on a 1.6 GHz Athlon (marketing name XP1900+)

;W[ea];B[fc]
C[zapp [?\]: Does it play much stronger using more time on 9x9
]
;W[gb]C[gunnar [?\]: Doubtful.
];B[id]
C[gunnar [?\]: GNU thinks the corner will die.
zapp [?\]: For Viking every second makes a difference
]
;W[ic];B[ha]C[zapp [?\]: Viking agrees with that
];W[cb];B[da];W[fa]
C[zapp [?\]: At 3 minutes per move Viking is pretty good
];B[db]
;W[ie];B[hf];W[if];B[hg];W[ig];B[hh]C[zapp [?\]: Good game for gnu
gunnar [?\]: Looks like white collapsed.
gunnar [?\]: G2 was a gift.
zapp [?\]: As a said: at C3 viking probably felt it was behind
gunnar [?\]: Interesting that they both thought so. :-)
zapp [?\]: I should have implemented an idea to spend twice the time on first move out of book
zapp [?\]: I am rerunning Viking for position it played G2
gunnar [?\]: What is the right move?
zapp [?\]: 1ply G3 2ply G3 3ply G4
zapp [?\]: Which means it played G2 because of the random nature of monte carlo eval

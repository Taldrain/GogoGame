C[zapp [?\]: burtabel, viking does not use bensons it plays random games to the end

;W[kj];B[ck];W[ii]
C[zapp [?\]: And if all random games wins it simply plays any move
]
;B[hf]C[burtabel [3d\]: ok i see
];W[hj];B[dk]
C[zapp [?\]: But in a close game losing those stones would be a disaster
]
;W[ej]C[zapp [?\]: And in 99% of the case it will play correctly

C[zapp [?\]: Viking is also more pessimistic

;B[eh]C[gunnar [?\]: GNU doesn't seem worried about the left side.

C[zapp [?\]: Not in computer go...
];B[cg]
C[gunnar [?\]: Somehow the owl reading found out correctly but didn't play to defend it anyway.
burtabel [3d\]: maybe semeai overruled it?
zapp [?\]: This is often what happens when viking beats gnu

;W[ie];B[fb]
C[zapp [?\]: It desperately tries something and gnu stumbles on a bug

;W[hd];B[gc]C[Gresil [16k\]: viking5 has superior luck code, eh

;W[hb]
C[zapp [?\]: Good comment. Since it is based on playing random games to the end it actually measures luck all the time

;B[fl];W[fm]
C[zapp [?\]: It plays the move that seems to possibly be the most lucky one

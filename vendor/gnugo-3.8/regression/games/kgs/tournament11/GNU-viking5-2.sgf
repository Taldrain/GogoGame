C[zapp [?\]: Since Viking only searches 1 ply on 13x13 it appears to vervalue sente moves
]
;B[gg];W[cf];B[jc]
C[burtabel [3d\]: well GNU Go only "searches" 1 ply too
];W[kc]
C[burtabel [3d\]: but has a lot of special code to guess the value of (reverse) sente moves
zapp [?\]: On 9x9 however viking searches 2-4 ply depending on position and stage of the game

C[gunnar [?\]: GNU says B+6.
];B[cc];W[hg]
C[burtabel [3d\]: I think W is leading
gunnar [?\]: Now B+0.10.

];B[li];W[lj]
;B[hf]C[gunnar [?\]: GNU agrees now. W+3.

C[zapp [?\]: Now viking is starting to get desperate
gunnar [?\]: Viking blundered away some points and now the C7 cut aji is gone.

;B[bh];W[ch]C[zapp [?\]: Yes, it is to weak tactically in the endgame
zapp [?\]: I need to use time more efficient
burtabel [3d\]: before that GNU Go played some negative moves.. (K3, E6)

C[zapp [?\]: This is a thought that is in my mind
];B[cm]
C[zapp [?\]: But right now I only have my laptop
];W[dm]
C[burtabel [3d\]: easier thought than done..

C[trogdor [-\]: well, for montecarlo it should be easy.

C[zapp [?\]: But a multicore stationary PC is on the wishlist

burtabel [3d\]: well Black had a chance in lower left
burtabel [3d\]: d2 instead of b1 lives?
gunnar [?\]: No.
zapp [?\]: If C5 is sent?
gunnar [?\]: It's not.
burtabel [3d\]: how can White kill?
burtabel [3d\]: after D2?
gunnar [?\]: Down to C1.
burtabel [3d\]: then Black B1 and A2
zapp [?\]: I need to enter my bathtub quickly
zapp [?\]: see you
gunnar [?\]: Uh, yeah, I was thinking false eye when it wasn't.
gunnar [?\]: So C2 should have been C1?

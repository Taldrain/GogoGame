This suite of semeai problems came from the package STS-RV
available at http://gobase.org/reading/preview/Semeai/#STS

It is a very comprehensive semeai problems suite
compiled by Ricard Vilà. The associated tests are in GTP
format but it's not a perfect match for GNU Go because
it uses a custom command called solve_semeaiS.
(More info at http://trac.gnugo.org/gnugo/ticket/41)


The files STS-RV_*.tst instead are based on the normal GNU
Go commands (analyze_semeai) and enable the execution
of all the tests in the STS-RV suite of semeai problems.

In the GNU Go distribution of STS-RV, the tests taken from "Get Strong
at Tesuji" and "Counting Liberties and Winning Capturing Races" are
for now excluded, due to missing knowledge about exactly how far the
permissions given to Ricard Vilà by Richard Bozulich and Richard
Hunter extend. The tests can still be found at the URL:s referred
above, however.

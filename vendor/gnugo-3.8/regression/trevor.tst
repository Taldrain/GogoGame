#Dan said:
#Looking at unsorted test 5, a typical way to solve this would be
#to add an edge Joseki pattern, such as this:
#
#Pattern EJ84
#
#......       Atari before connecting
#..*...
#X.XO..
#.XO...
#......
#......
#------
#
#:8,J
#
#One should also add a pattern or two for followup. A pattern
#with type J is given a weight of 27 on a 19x19 board, which
#means that it is played automatically unless there is something
#really huge on the board.
#
#Unfortunately, this does not work. The problem is that the values of
#J patterns are scaled. From shapes.c:
#
#  if (class & CLASS_J) {
#    TRACE("...joseki standard move\n");
#    add_expand_territory_move(ti, tj);
#    TRACE("...expands territory\n");
#    add_expand_moyo_move(ti, tj);

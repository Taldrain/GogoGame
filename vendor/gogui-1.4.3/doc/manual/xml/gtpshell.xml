<title>Commands Altering the Board State</title>
<para>
GoGui supports to send GTP commands directly from a file or entered in the
GTP shell. However, this is only allowed for commands that don't change the
board state, for instance for sending configuration commands from a file or
for querying the state with commands that are not configured as analyze
commands yet.
</para>
</warning>

<para>
If text is selected in the text area of the shell (e.g. text written by the
program to standard error), it will automatically parsed for valid points,
which will be marked on the board while the text is selected.
</para>

<para>
Text lines that are written by the program to standard error and start
with the string "WARNING:", "Warning:", or "warning:" will be displayed
with an orange color.

<para>
GoGui is a graphical interface to programs that play the game of Go and use
the
<ulink url="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/">Go Text Protocol</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
It is especially useful for Go program developers, since it allows
direct communication with the program by sending any GTP command
and to log and save the stream of sent GTP commands
to facilitate debugging and reproducing errors.

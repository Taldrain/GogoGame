.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Adapter program for playing games between two Go programs supporting GTP (Go Text Protocol)\&.
.PP
Optional observer and referee GTP Go programs can be used for observing the game and answering commands related to the final game score\&.
TwoGtp
forwards the following commands to all programs (command translation is done for protocol version 1 programs):

\fBfinal_status_list\fR
.RE
.sp
The command
\fBgenmove\fR
is forwarded only to the program of the corresponding color, the other programs are informed about the move with a
\fBplay\fR
command\&. GTP extension commands implemented by exactly one of the programs are forwarded to the program\&. The special comment line
\fB#\ \&interrupt\fR, used by
GoGui
to interrupt commands, is forwarded to all programs\&.
.PP
If the option
\fB\-sgffile\fR
is used, the games are saved after they are finished and a result text file in table format is created with some statistics\&. If the program(s) support the GTP command
\fBcputime\fR, these statistics include CPU times\&. The errors in the statistics are the standard errors (confidence interval 68%)\&. They are computed by the standard deviation of the results, divided by the square root of the number of unique games, which is correct only for a sufficiently large number of games (especially if the percentage of wins is close to 0% or 100%)\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-alternate\fR
.RS 4
Alternate colors\&. Black and White are exchanged every odd game; the scores saved in the results table
\fB\-sgffile\fR
are still using the name Black and White, as given with
\fB\-black\fR
and
\fB\-white\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-analyze\fR \fIfile\&.dat\fR
.RS 4
Analyze the result file
\fIfile\&.dat\fR\&. Creates a HTML file
\fIfile\&.html\fR
with links to the games and summary statistics\&. Also creates a text file
\fIfile\&.summary\&.dat\fR, with a table row containing the most important summary statistics\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-auto\fR
.RS 4
Automatically play games\&. Use this option if you want to run
TwoGtp
as a standalone program, without a program like
GoGui
which controls the move generation with
\fBgenmove\fR
commands\&. If a result file already exists (as specified with
\fB\-sgffile\fR), and contains less games than specified with
\fB\-games\fR, the remaining games will be played\&. Use
\fB\-force\fR
to overwrite existing result files\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-black\fR \fIcommand\fR
.RS 4
Command for the black program\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-compare\fR
.RS 4
Compare a list of SGF files given as arguments an exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-config\fR \fIfile\fR
.RS 4
Read command line options and arguments from the given file\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-force\fR
.RS 4
Overwrite existing files\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-debugtocomment\fR
.RS 4
Store all text that was written by each program to the standard error stream during the move generation in the comment properties of the SGF file\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-games\fR \fIn\fR
.RS 4
Number of games to play (0 means no limit)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-help\fR
.RS 4
Display help and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-komi\fR \fIkomi\fR
.RS 4
Komi\&. If this option is not used, a default komi of 6\&.5 will be used\&. The komi cannot be changed at runtime\&. The
\fBkomi\fR
GTP command will succeed, if the argument has the same value as the configured komi and fail otherwise\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-maxmoves\fR \fIn\fR
.RS 4
Limit the maximum number of moves\&. Can be useful if some games would not terminate otherwise\&. Default is 1000\&. \-1 means no limit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-observer\fR \fIcommand\fR
.RS 4
Command for the observer program\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-openings\fR \fIdirectory\fR
.RS 4
Use openings from SGF files in the given directory\&. The openings will be cycled through in alphabetical order\&. If option
\fB\-alternate\fR
is set, each opening is played twice with colors exchanged\&. If
TwoGtp
is used as a GTP engine, the opening moves will be returned to the controller as responses to the first
\fBgenmove\fR
GTP commands\&. Note that in this case opening files with non\-alternating moves or setup stones are not supported (this is currently not checked and will result in undefined behavior)\&. In automatic mode (see
\fB\-auto\fR), there is no such restriction\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-referee\fR \fIcommand\fR
.RS 4
Command for the referee program\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-sgffile\fR \fIprefix\fR
.RS 4
Save games after they are finished with filename
\fIprefix\fR\-\fIn\fR\&.sgf
(\fIn\fR
is the game number)\&. The results are appended to the file
\fIprefix\fR\&.dat\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-size\fR \fIn\fR
.RS 4
Board size for games\&. If this option is not used, the size will be set with the
\fBboardsize\fR
command, or the default size 19 will be used when option
\fB\-auto\fR
is set\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-threads\fR \fIn\fR
.RS 4
Use multi\-threading\&. Setting the number of threads to a value greater than 1 will create multiple instances of the Go programs to play n games in parallel\&. Can only be used together with option
\fB\-auto\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-time\fR \fItimespec\fR
.RS 4
Set time limits (basetime[+overtime/moves])\&. The base time and overtime (byoyomi) can have an optional unit specifier (m or min for minutes; s or sec for seconds; default is minutes)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-verbose\fR
.RS 4
Print debugging messages\&. This will print GTP commands and responses and text written to the standard error stream by the programs to the standard error stream\&. If option
\fB\-threads\fR
is used, only the debugging messages of the first thread are written\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-version\fR
.RS 4
Print version and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-white\fR \fIcommand\fR
.RS 4
Command for the white program\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-xml\fR
.RS 4
Save games in XML format\&.
.RE
.SH "GTP EXTENSIONS"
.PP
.PP
\fBgogui\-interrupt\fR
.RS 4
Indicate interrupt ability for GoGui\&.
TwoGtp
will forward the interrupt to both programs, with the appropriate method, if they implement either
\fBgogui\-interrupt\fR
or
\fBgogui\-sigint\fR\&. See the chapter "Interrupting Commands" in the
GoGui
documentation\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBgogui\-title\fR

Return a title for the current game, consisting of the game number (if option
\fB\-sgffile\fR
was used) and the player names\&.

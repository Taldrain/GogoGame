9x9 opening positions which can be used for twogtp with the -openings
option.

The positions were selected from dan-level games of various sources
and from http://www.smartgo.com/sgf/tourney9.sgf (courtesy of Anders Kierulf).

They should be roughly balanced, but it is still recommended to play each of
them twice with colors exchanged and average over the results
(twogtp -alternate option).
